Goal Post:

- Dimensions: L x H = 7.3m x 2.4m ✓
- Map displaying all shots taken ✓

Shot taker:

- Shot staying in the goal post is based on the Penalties section of the dataset (prob of hit  = pen/100)
- Shot accuracy determined by SHO category (We will have a normal model based on that)
- Better SHO the lower the standard deviation from the shot
- Higher shot power makes the ball harder to stop for the keeper, but it also increases the standard deviation on your shot accuracy
- To determine where the player will take the shot we will use random variables, but this will be based on probability of their preferred foot
  players who are right footed tend to shoot to the left vice versa, players with higher overall have more variability

Goal Keeper:

- Start position of the keeper depends on the positioning of the GK Pos column
- GK Diving affects the goal keepers reach
- GK reflex is the factor that will show us the probability of the keeper jumping the right way
- There will be a keeper are that will be use a blocking area
- Whether a goal is scored or not will be dependent on if the blocked area and ball overlap
- If the ball is on the edge of the block area then there will be a mechanism that will model the deflection chance of the goal being scored

Variability:

- Check what is the best order for the team
- Simulation can be repeated to understand what the keeper must do to save more goals
- We can also simulate a single scorer to find out his tendencies to score

Questions:

- Best team order?
- What is the best possible team out of all the players?
- Measure player tendencies (setup teams such that they only take one player at a time)
- How many rounds does the penalty shootout last at average?
- Help in team selection

(more stuff can be added for now this is the basic plan)
